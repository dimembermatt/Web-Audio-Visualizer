# Web-Audio-Visualizer
## Under development by Ryan Menghani, Gauraang Dhamankar, and Matthew Yu of the University of Texas at Austin.
### Current Visualizer in beta: Static Particle Visualizer (V1)
#### To view, go the website https://dimembermatt.github.io/Web-Audio-Visualizer/, and click on the Static Particle Visualizer button.
#### Load your own mp3 or one of the mp3s provided (downloadable from the audio folder in the repo), and press __play__!
#### The top left hand side has a menu of options you can use to change how the visualizer looks, such as particle size or cellular automata mode.

##### The other two current disabled visualizers are in development(?).
##### We also hope to host this on our own domain (eventually).
