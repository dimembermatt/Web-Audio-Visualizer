# Web-Audio-Visualizer
## Under development by Ryan Menghani, Gauraang Dhamankar, and Matthew Yu of the University of Texas at Austin.
### In order to test, run the html page on a localhost (preferably through 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer') and going to your local directory (i.e., http://localhost:8000/Github/Web-Audio-Visualizer/index.html).
### Default song is Scars by Papa Roach.
#### P5 tests include raindrops and particle. Particle is currently merging with Quadtree and works on test3.html (if you can call it working).
